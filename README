~~~~~!!!!!TEACHING TIME!!!!!~~~~~
Pull up a chair and prepare to learn.

Downloading the Source(about 30-40GB of files):
----------------------------------------------
    * Make your project directory =>     "mkdir ~/oct"
    * Navigate or change directory to your project directory =>    "cd ~/oct"
    * Initialize the project =>   "repo init -u git://github.com/CJDubbsy/manifest -b kk-4.4"
    * Sync the aosp files to your machine =>    "repo sync"
    * Create the device tree manifest  => "jet/repo.sh samsung nexus"
    * Sync the device files => "repo sync"
    
Building the Device:
--------------------
    * Choose the supported device and type => "jet/SUPPORTED_DEVICE.sh n (CORES+1)"
      -> for jflte and a quad core device you would type "jet/jflte.sh n 5" don't forget the n and number.  it defaults to n but it defaults to 21 threads/cores

Build will take roughly 3-6 hours depending on machine.

Thanks for playing!
